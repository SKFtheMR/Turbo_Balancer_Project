# Turbo Balancer Project
## Introduction

The Turbo Balancer Project aims to provide a precise, automated solution for balancing 
turbocharger assemblies. This system uses:

- **Accelerometer Sensors**: To measure vibrations and identify imbalances.
- **DC Motor Control**: For physical adjustments during the balancing process.
- **RPM Feedback**: To monitor rotational speed and ensure accurate measurements.

The project includes both hardware components (sensor interface, motor control) and a 
graphical user interface (GUI) for easy operation.

## Key Features

### Hardware Components:
1. **Accelerometer Sensors**:
   - Measure vibrations during rotation.
   - Provide real-time feedback on imbalance.

2. **DC Motor Control System**:
   - Adjusts the position of weights to balance the assembly.
   - Controlled via motor drivers and microcontrollers.

3. **RPM Feedback System**:
   - Monitors rotational speed for precise balancing calculations.

### Software Components:
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Intuitive interface for system operation.
   - Real-time data visualization of vibrations and RPM.
   - Interactive controls for motor adjustments.

2. **Data Processing and Analysis**:
   - Reads sensor data, processes it, and calculates imbalance.
   - Maps imbalances to specific components for correction.

3. **Local and Network Deployment Options**:
   - Run the system locally on a workstation.
   - Deploy in a networked environment for remote monitoring and control.

## Project Workflow

The Turbo Balancer workflow consists of three main stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Measure vibrations and RPM using sensors during assembly 
rotation.
2. **Data Processing**: Analyze collected data to identify imbalance locations and 
magnitudes.
3. **Balancing**: Use motor controls to adjust weights and achieve precision balance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**:
  - Accelerometer sensors (compatible with your microcontroller).
  - DC motor and driver system.
  - Computer or embedded device for processing and control.

- **Software**:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Dependencies: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pyserial`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turbo-balancer.git
   cd turbo-balancer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib pyserial
   ```

3. Set up your hardware components according to the documentation in the 
`documentation` folder.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Data Collection

- Start the GUI application and connect your sensors.
- Rotate the turbocharger assembly at a controlled RPM.
- Collect vibration data from the accelerometer.

### 2. Data Processing

- The system processes raw sensor data to identify imbalance magnitude and location.
- Generate visualizations of the imbalance in real-time.

### 3. Balancing

- Use the GUI controls to adjust motor positions based on the identified imbalances.
- Monitor the balancing process through live feedback from sensors.

## Development and Testing

1. **Development**:
   - Modify or extend functionality under `src/gui/` and `src/firmware/`.
   - Follow existing coding conventions for consistency.

2. **Testing**:
   - Test individual components (e.g., motor control, sensor data processing) 
separately.
   - Conduct integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between hardware and 
software components.
